<h3 align="left">👩‍💻  About Me</h3>

###

<p align="left"><br>
I'm an aspiring front-end developer with a focus on crafting visually appealing and interactive web experiences. 🌐

Currently, I'm immersed in the world of front-end development, with a focus on: HTML, CSS, JavaScript along with React

🐍 Although my journey began with Python, where I honed my problem-solving skills and built some small projects (including a web scraper), my current focus is squarely on front-end technologies. Python will always hold a special place in my heart as my first programming language. ❤️

💡 One of my noteworthy project in Python was creating a web scraper. This real-world project helped me solve the problem of job searching and keeping track of opportunities by scraping job listings from websites and storing them in Google Sheets.

🚀 I'm always eager to learn and collaborate on exciting projects. Let's connect, share knowledge, and code together to explore new horizons in web development!

📫 Feel free to reach out to me here on GitHub. Let's embark on this coding journey together!
